          The 2020 Mahindra off-raoder is based on a new platform and is bigger
          in dimensions as compared to the first-gen model. It gets powered by a
          2.0-litre petrol and 2.2-litre diesel engine. The former develops
          150bhp of power and 320 Nm of peak torque, while the latter puts out
          power and torque outputs of 130 PS and 320 Nm. Transmission duties are
          done by a 5-speed MT or a 5-speed torque converter automatic gearbox.
          The 2020 Mahindra Thar is offered at a starting price of Rs 9.80 lakh
          (ex-showroom, Delhi).
